  - [ ] Energy algorithm?
           - some resource exclusion scheme for energy stuff!!
               - Perhaps just have a maximum number of hosts to use, which is a configuration parameter of the scheduling scheme? Or perhaps just some fraction of the available compute nodes? Or a fraction of the total node * cores * GHz
               - Or some random subsetting
               - Should be parameterized with some number/fraction... should likely be part of the scheme name? 
                

    - [ ] Come up with an idea for experiments/paper
      - [ ] Compare --no-contention to explore the benefit of using "accurate simulation" instead of "inaccurate model" (should be a small dunk)
      - [ ] Overhead
