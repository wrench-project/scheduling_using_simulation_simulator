  - [X] Make it possible to have algorithm selection triggered whenever a workflow level completes
  - [ ] Implement some bi-objective energy/makespan thing
    - [ ] Implement a new "micro" simulation noise scheme (which could totally change results)
        - [X] for the application
        - [X] for the platform
        - [ ] for both? 
    - [X] Have children report on energy as well as makespan
    - [X] Implement a simple scheme
    - [X] Add watts to cluster descriptions
    - [ ] Implement energy-specific resource selection schemes
            - min watts
            - min watts / flops
