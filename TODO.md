  - [ ] New task selection scheme: most children
  - [ ] Add a FULLY RANDOM algorithm
  - [ ] Add "sequence of algorithms" as output to the simulator
  - [ ] Add a JSON/csv to the repo with results
  - [ ] Augment plotting to distinguish individual algorithms
  - [ ] Output statistics
    - How often is each "green" algorithm good?
    - What are the sequences of algorithms? 
    - How often is each green algorithm used in a "good" sequence?
    - etc.
  - [ ] Come up with platform scenarios
     - One homegeneous for sure
     - Several heterogeneous?
  - [ ] Come up with worfklow scenarios: 
     - All "standard" workflows with 1000 tasks
        - 10 samples

  - [ ] Have the simulator output total power consumption
