  - [X] Make it possible to have algorithm selection triggered whenever a workflow level completes
  - [ ] Implement some bi-objective energy/makespan thing
    - [X] Implement a new "micro" simulation noise scheme (which could totally change results)
    - [ ] Have children report on energy as well as makespan
    - [ ] Implement a simple scheme
