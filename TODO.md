  - Refactor the --cluster argument to be "--clusters  x:y:z:w,x:y:z:w"
  - Have the simulator output a JSON (sort the cluster specs)
        (in general make sure that the JSON is deterministic)
  - Have the simulator output total power consumption
  - Add a "bottome-level" task scheduling approach
